-ism
===

-ism is a simple project based on a friend of mine. Sometimes when he is talking he completely butchers a common phrase and it just makes you scratch your head.

A demo can be found by clicking this link: http://www.ism.JoeyGrasso.com

### Background / Specs 'n Stuff
I am writing this in PHP using CodeIgniter (https://ellislab.com/codeigniter), CSS (http://getbootstrap.com), and with some Google Web Fonts thrown in. MySQL and such for the data. I'm going to do my best to keep it anonymized that way you can clone it, throw it on your server and then have a simple quote site for your friend, celebrity, politician, or whoever.

### Features
Basically when you go to the site there will be a textarea allowing you to put in a quote and a button to submit. Your quote will be added to the list and displayed. The quotes will be shown with the most recent ones first. Then you can upvote (thumbs-up) to show your appreciation for that particular -ism.

You can add an admin username and password that way you can moderate against abuse. Basically site_url/admin to login, and once logged in you will be able to click a red 'x' to delete it from the list of quotes

### Requirements
PHP 5.3+
MYSQL
Web server


### Questions/Comments/What-Have-Yous

I'd love to see this expand, and I think it is pretty funny because we all have that friend that should have a book of their axiom.
